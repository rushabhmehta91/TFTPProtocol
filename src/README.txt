1: Compile all java files
2: Run TftpClient.java
3: You will get a prompt like mytftp> you can enter commands here (eg: mytftp>connect glados.cs.rit.edu )
4: If you type only connect it will connect to default server i.e. glados.cs.rit.edu.
5: You can get any file but file with size more than 0.5mb takes around a minute to get downloaded.
   So be patient and listen music. As soon as download is done it will give the prompt back i.e mytftp>
6: If wrong host name is provided client won't connect.
7: Retransmission is done 5 times after every 5 seconds. Timeout takes place after in 5 attempts
8: You can type ? to get command help.
9: Execution is very simple. Enjoy executing the code. If you have any question send me a email at rdm6138@rit.edu
